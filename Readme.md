Resurrection
============

A (very) simple puzzle-solving interactive story game written in Python.

Story:

The main character is Death - an overworked being who has to keep track of all the souls that are going to the other side. Since the "powers that be" added the concept of extra lives to the world, Death and their assistants have to guide back the ones who have earnt an extra chance at life back to the realm of the living.

To bring someone back, Death must find the three parts of the person - their memories, their flesh, and their passion for living.

Often, these parts are scattered among plane of existance Death operates, and so it can be an arduous task...

You play one of Death's new assistants, and you have to (with a bit of guidance from your boss) recover the three parts of someone who needs to be resurrected.
